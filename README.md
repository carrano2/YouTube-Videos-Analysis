### YouTube Videos Analysis Project

## Business Question:

Based on the dataset, what were the most popular youtube videos/channels in the US?

I will use my Excel skills to answer this question.

## Findings/Conclusion

Due to the intentionally vague business question asked by the fictitious stakeholder I went about answering the question from four different angles.  Firstly I defined "popular" on youtube as the top 10 most interacted Youtube videos.  I defined interacted as the sum of all the total likes, comments, and dislikes. Secondly, I defined it as the top 10 most viewed Youtube videos.  Thirdly, as the top 10 youtube channels that appeared on the Youtube trending section, and fourthly the top 10 highest average viewed Youtube channels.

The results of which are found in the dashboard section of the attached Excel file.
